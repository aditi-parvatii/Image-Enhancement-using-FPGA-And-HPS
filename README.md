# Image-Enhancement-using-FPGA-And-HPS
## An Overview:
The project focuses on implementing image enhancement techniques on Field 
Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Traditionally, image processing methods are 
implemented using software-based tools like MATLAB or Digital Signal Processors 
(DSPs). However, this project introduces a new approach by utilizing the parallel 
processing capabilities of FPGAs for real-time configurable image enhancement.

As we know, Image enhancement refers to the process of improving the quality, clarity, 
or visual appearance of an image. It involves various techniques and algorithms designed 
to enhance specific aspects of an image, such as brightness, contrast, sharpness, color 
balance, or noise reduction. The goal of image enhancement is to make the image more 
visually appealing, easier to interpret, or better suited for a particular application.
The specific image enhancement techniques used in the project include thresholding, 
contrast adjustment, brightness adjustment, and inverting. These techniques involve 
manipulating the RGB values of each pixel in the image, aiming to improve the human 
interpretation of the image.

The project highlights the advantages of FPGA-based implementation, such as high 
processing speed and reconfigurability. Unlike implementing image processing in 
MATLAB or using DSPs, the parallel nature of FPGAs offers a different approach and 
potential performance benefits.

## Objective:
The primary objective of the project is to demonstrate and improve the real-time 
configurable results of image enhancement on FPGAs. The project acknowledges the 
significance of image processing in fields like healthcare and multimedia services.
Overall, the project presents a novel approach to image enhancement by leveraging the 
capabilities of FPGAs, aiming to enhance the interpretability of images for human 
perception
